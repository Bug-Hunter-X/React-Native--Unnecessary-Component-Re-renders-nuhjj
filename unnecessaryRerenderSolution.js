Several strategies can prevent unnecessary re-renders:

1. **`useMemo` hook:** Use `useMemo` to memoize expensive computations that don't change between renders:

```javascript
function MyComponent({ data }) {
  const displayedName = useMemo(() => data.name, [data.name]);

  // ... rest of component
}
```

2. **`React.memo` higher-order component:** Wrap your component with `React.memo` to prevent re-renders if props haven't changed:

```javascript
const MemoizedComponent = React.memo(MyComponent);
```

3. **Precise `useEffect` dependencies:** Only include the necessary values in the dependency array of `useEffect` to minimize unnecessary re-renders:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
    console.log('Component re-rendered!');
}, [data.name]); // Only re-renders if data.name changes
```

4. **Immutable Data Updates:** If using state, ensure that you're updating the state immutably to avoid unnecessary re-renders.  Avoid directly modifying the state object. Instead create a copy of the state and modify that before setting the new state. 

By applying these methods, you can dramatically reduce the number of unnecessary re-renders in your React Native application, improving overall performance.
